# naiveBayes
Implement Naive Bayes

This assignment is about replicating existing an algorithm from scratch. You are 
asked to write function(s) (in Python) for the Naïve Baye’s algorithm. You are 
also required to analyze Titanic data set. 

Here are the considerations for the algorithm:

	a.	Restrict to only categorical features
	b.	Give an error message if continuous features are provided
	c.	Function must have at least three parameters: Train, Test, 
		Classification variable
	d.	Output produces predicted probability and classification 
	e.	Use Titanic data to predict survival.
